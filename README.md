# YouTubeDataScraping
This project connects to YouTube via GoogleAPI and scrapes various information about a video, channel or playlists in a channel.
This is a hobby project and at this stage, the code scrapes title, publish time, description, channel title, number of likes, number of views, duration of the video and, number of comments. It can also go further and extact comments per given video link. 

To setup your project to work with GoogleAPI follow this tutorial https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/using-youtube-api-in-python. To run the code, you need OAuth client ID and credentials (a json file). 

To understand YouTube metrics you can refer to this link: https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/metrics

NOTE: I have implemented the code in pycharm.
